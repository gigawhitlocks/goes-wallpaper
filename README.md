# A GOES wallpaper changer for Gnome 3
Sets the wallpaper of your Gnome desktop to the current GOES East image.
Add a line that runs the script to your crontab to check for an update every few minutes to have a dynamic wallpaper that shows a recentish image of the southeastern US. An example (of my) crontab is included; yours will be slightly different.

Everything is hardcoded, but it should be easy to modify. Maybe someday I'll make this a little more polished so that it is usable by people who don't already know how to use cron, and scripts, and such. But not today.
